# VaR-Calculation
This project calculates the Value at Risk (VaR) of a financial portfolio using a parametric method, based on the simulated returns following a normal distribution. The calculation is performed based on a specified confidence level and helps estimate the maximum potential loss in a portfolio over a given period.
